# Convey 0.6.1

As I continued to work on what used to be my MonogameUI project I quickly realized that the direction the project was headed was not going to have the efficiency required by a video game.
I began to strip out a lot of the features in order to make MonogameUI usable for gaming. As I was doing this I thought "Why not split MonogameUI in two?" Each with it's own focus. Hence Convey was born.

The goal with Convey will be  to create a library that will enable the user to create 2D User Interfaces for MonoGame. The current concept is to take inspiration from jQueryUI mimicking much of it's elements and features.

Currently Convey is still under heavy development and is not recommended for use.
